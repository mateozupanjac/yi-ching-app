# Yi Ching App

Application is based on Yi Ching philosophy,
which structure holds 4096 combinations of possibilities,
application functions as your personal ally when in doubt or in search of answers.

User types a question into the input field and clicks x6 times "Toss Coins" to complete Yi Ching predictions. For every click algorithm creates a line based on three coins that had been thrown. Application defines which line to return based on "head" and "tail" which randomly resulted after tossing the coins.

Three lines creates first part of the Yi Ching structure which is called "Trigram", two trigrams gives complete Yi Ching structure prediction which is called "Hexagram", so the final result should give six lines starting from bottom to the top. 

User can get one or two Hexagrams, result will depend on the structure of your question. Question that is better constucted will get more accurate answer from the application.
When structure is completed user gets a corresponding card (or two) which will answer the question in greater detail, it also shows comments or directions from people who had studied Yi Ching in the past.

User can save his/her questions and answers for later, so after some time he/she can return and compare the truthfulness of Yi Ching.

Some extra features will be added in the future which will not affect application logic and algorithm, it will be aimed in sharing it's questions/answers to the social networks and such.
